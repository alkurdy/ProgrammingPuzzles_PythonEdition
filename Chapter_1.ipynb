    "### Understanding `__init__` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method in Python is a special method used to initialize a newly created object. It's often referred to as the \"constructor\" of a class because it is called automatically when an instance (object) of the class is created. This method allows you to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to the instance attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points About `__init__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The primary purpose of `__init__` is to initialize the object's attributes when the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic Call**: When you create a new instance of a class (e.g., `my_object = MyClass()`), Python automatically calls the `__init__` method if it is defined in the class.\n",

    "3. **Self Parameter**: The `self` parameter in `__init__` refers to the instance of the class being created. It allows you to access and modify the attributes of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional Method**: The `__init__` method is optional. If you don't define it, Python will use a default constructor that does nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Not a Return Type**: The `__init__` method does not return any value (not even `None`). It is expected to only set up the object's initial state.\n"

    "##### Common Magic Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python defines many operators, each associated with a corresponding magic method. For instance, the `+` operator is linked to the `__add__` method. When you use `+` in an expression, Python calls the `__add__` method behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "| **Operator** | **Magic Method** | **How to Call** | **Description** |\n",
    "|--------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| `+`          | `__add__`        | `self + x`      | Adds `self` and `x`. |\n",
    "| `-`          | `__sub__`        | `self - x`      | Subtracts `x` from `self`. |\n",
    "| `*`          | `__mul__`        | `self * x`      | Multiplies `self` and `x`. |\n",
    "| `/`          | `__truediv__`    | `self / x`      | Divides `self` by `x`. |\n",
    "| `==`         | `__eq__`         | `self == x`     | Checks if `self` is equal to `x`. |\n",
    "| `in`         | `__contains__`   | `x in self`     | Checks if `x` is in `self`. |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Magic Methods Work\n",

    "  - In the table, `self` refers to the object on which the method is being called, while `x` is another object involved in the operation.\n",
    "  - The type of `x` determines which magic method is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an operator in an expression, Python determines the type of `x` and then calls the appropriate magic method defined for that type. This mechanism allows for the customization of operator behavior in Python classes.\n"
